# Project Agent Guidance

## C++ Type Naming

- New C++ classes, including interface classes, do not need the legacy `Ob` prefix.
- Keep the `I` prefix for interface classes. For example, use `ICacheMemoryGetter` instead of `ObICacheMemoryGetter`.
- Do not rename existing types only to remove the `Ob` prefix unless the task explicitly requires it.

## C++ Headers

- Use `#pragma once` in new C++ header files instead of macro-based `#ifndef`/`#define` include guards.

## Code Review

- For pull request or diff review tasks, read and follow `.agents/skills/code-review/SKILL.md`.

## Test Placement

- Prefer adding regression and correctness coverage to the repository's established test suites and test directories.
- Avoid adding test-only or benchmark-only files under `tools/` unless the task specifically requires a reusable developer tool.

## Development Artifact Cleanup

- After completing feature work or tests, remove build outputs and other development artifacts created during the task that are no longer needed, including temporary test instances and profiling files.
- Preserve pre-existing or unrelated files and artifacts still needed for ongoing work or verification; do not use broad cleanup commands that could remove them.
